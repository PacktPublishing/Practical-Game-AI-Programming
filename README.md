# Practical Game AI Programming
This is the code repository for [Practical Game AI Programming](https://www.packtpub.com/game-development/practical-game-ai-programming?utm_source=GitHub), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Moving on, you’ll explore how to work with animations. You’ll also plan and create pruning strategies, and create Theta algorithms to find short and realistic looking game paths. Next, you’ll learn how the AI should behave when there is a lot of characters in the same scene.

You'll explore which methods and algorithms, such as possibility maps, Forward Chaining Plan, Rete Algorithm, Pruning Strategies, Wall Distances, and Map Preprocess Implementation should be used on different occasions. You’ll discover how to overcome some limitations, and how to deliver a better experience to the player. By the end of the book, you think differently about AI.
## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
if (playerPosition == "triggerM") 
{ 

  transform.LookAt(playerSoldier); // Face the direction of the   player
 
 transform.position = Vector3.MoveTowards
  (transform.position, 
 buildingPosition.position, walkBack);
 
 backwardsFire();
 
} 
```

It is recommended that you have install a game engine that uses C# (Unity3D has a free version, and it was used for the examples covered on the book).
